# Doug Black Official Power Rankings
## Week 5

You know what? I'm sorry.

I'm sorry that two years ago I looked at the GroupMe and saw that it was boring and decided to open up a text file and put the fourteen of us in order to try to breathe some OC life into this whole thing. I'm sorry that all of your egos were so small that you latched onto my rankings with such force that when I was late/missed a few weeks of rankings last season all hell broke loose and you quickly searched elsewhere for your fix.

You searched desperately for something--anything really--to satiate your newfound addiction. Rather than put actual effort into it, several league members decided to throw some numbers into a spreadsheet and call it "math". Now, these new rankings weren't all that great, but because they were marketed with "math"--which you've always been bad at--you wanted to believe they were just as good, just as relevant as mine. You knew they weren't, but you would have been happy with randomly generated rankings at that point. The thought of going through a week without the league and universe having an _order_ to it was too painful to bear. That would be a return to the chaotic times of the pre-rankings dark age of WPFL. I know you couldn't handle that.

I'm sorry that I went back to the lab again this offseason and enhanced my shit until its dopeness levels were too much. I really probably shouldn't have. I should have known your fragile psyches couldn't handle any more dopeness. Long form justifications of each ranking? Prologues on par with most league notes? It was almost too much.

I'm sorry that after flooding your dopamine receptors with dopeness for three straight weeks I suddenly withheld my product last week. Predictably, you were traumatized. You lashed out. Denial, anger, acceptance, anger, more anger, more rage. The classic phases of withdrawal. Anyways, I'm back.

I'm finishing this while waiting at baggage claim at the Las Vegas airport. Yes, I'm on vacation and still working on this. But here it is. I've rolled you a fresh one, make sure to inhale.

You ingrateful fucks.

### 1. Dave (LARRY LEGEND'S VICTORY LAP)
`[--]` `126.2` `(4-1)`

Dave's undefeated streak has come to an end, as he finally dropped a game to a very handsome and successful fantasy owner. Still though, this team has stayed above 100 points for all five contests this season and remains our points for leader. The exact same players I mocked during my week one rankings--Bell, Murray, Fitzgerald, and Forte--as being questionable producers have made this team consistent as fuck. Dave would have beat literally any other team in the league this week had he not been playing me. He remains atop our week 5 rankings.

### 2. Doug (BEAUTIFUL DARK TWISTED FANTASY)
`[+4]` `132.6` `(4-1)`

I'm not gonna lie my pants have been tight for days now. I crushed it last week, putting up the second highest point total of the season (Fat Mike owns first with a 135 point performance in week 4). There's no need to overreact here though, Riddick and Elliot combined for 56 points which--while totally fucking awesome--is not something they've been doing consistently, and that's why this team isn't getting put first overall. Gostkowski continues to let me down, and I fear if he doesn't get his act together this team could miss the playoffs. He's my trump card.


### 3. Mike (TWO TDS AND THAT DENVER D)
`[--]` `87.1` `(4-1)`

This was Mike's worst performance of the season by almost 20 points. The team had poor performances pretty much across the board, _except_ for Tyrell Williams (`20`), which if you'll remember Mike picked up for $73 off week 2 waivers. Five weeks in and with only two double digit performances I think it's safe to say that, yes, Mike absolutely overbid for Williams. Obviously. So Mike had a down week, humorously one week after he was arguing he deserved the week 4 #1 spot in my power rankings. You dummy. But one down week doesn't mean this team isn't a top tier contender, so I'm not dropping him much.

### 4. Jimmy (STEPHANIA BELL GRANDE)
`[-2]` `121.8` `(3-2)`

I'm sad I didn't get around to week 4 rankings purely so I could take a shit all over Jimmy for his terrible, terrible week 4 performance. Last week Jimmy played Alex Chapla. Chapla put up 63 points, so Jimmy needed just 64 points to pull off the victory last week...and only managed 55. 55 points is the worst performance of the season so far. I feel like somehow this went unnoticed last week, probably because Alex isn't active enough on GroupMe to call things like this out, but we really dropped the ball here squad. When a man only gets FIFTY FIVE POINTS in a week there should be repercussions.

But enough about last week. This week Jimmy rebounded with a 121 point performance--his fourth triple digit performance--mostly thanks to David Johnson pulling off 32 points in San Francisco. For the second week in a row he picked a shit defense and it cost his output. All in all, things look solid here and this team remains a contender.

### 5. Neill (COUSIN RANDY'S REMEMBERANCE)
`[+1]` `117.2` `(3-2)` 8/10

Alright, I give up. It looks like the Falcons might be contenders this year, riding largely on a high powered offense that goes straight through fantasy powerhouses Freeman (`19.8`), Coleman (`24.3`), and Jones (`3.9`). Neill has hitched his cart to the Falcons wagon and at least through the first quarter of the season it appears to be going quite well for him. In other news, Brady (`29.6`) is back with a vengeance and that might be just what Neill's team needed to catapult it to top tier, two losses aside.

### 6. Todd (A TEAM HAS NO NAME)
`[+1]` `117.3` `(3-2)`

Alright Todd. Here we go.

Todd beat me in week 4 after we had talked what was by all accounts some pretty weak shit to one another and, in typical Todd fashion, would not shut the fuck up about it. So here we go Todd: You won. Todd beat me everyone.

No, Todd, I didn't skip the rankings because I was too devastated by my loss. No, Todd, I didn't skip rankings because I was too scared to rank you above my team. In fact, I've ranked your team _ahead_ of mine in two out of four rankings now. I skipped rankings because they're actually a pretty large amount of work and I'm an adult and have responsibilities (real responsibilities, not middle manager responsibilities) that sometimes--believe it or not--preclude writing thousand-word articles for the bemusement of some dudes in my fantasy football league.

Anyways, Todd's team is pretty good. Aside from shitting the bed week 3 this team has pretty consistent output in the 110s, which is good enough for 6th overall in PF. Looking forward, this team looks like it might have some injury trouble brewing. Five of his players questionable going into week 6. Good management will be crucial over the next few weeks for this team, especially if it wants to make the jump to top tier.

### 7. AJ (WAR BORTLES)
`[-3]` `77.2` `(2-3)`

This was AJ's third sub-100 performance of the season. His bad players keep playing terribly. Dontelle Inman (`0.8`) and the Bengals D/ST (`-1`) really let him down this week. His good players aren't playing good enough. I'm not sure what this team needs to do to turn it around but they've gotta do something as they keep slipping down the rankings each week.

### 8. Ryan (ALPHA KENYBODY)
`[+5]` `110.3` `(2-3)`

Ryan's last two performances have both cracked 100, a heartening sign of life from a team who two poor performances in weeks 2 and 3. However, when we look a little deeper I'm not sure we should feel all that good about last week's performance. His RBs combined for just 13 points, and he 60 of his points came from just three players. As I point out over and over again, having a diverse group of consistent scorers is far more reliable than hoping you get multiple breakouts each week. This team isn't the worst in the league by any stretch, but it's got work to do to compete in the post season.

### 9. Ean (MR. 500)
`[+1]` `84.1` `(2-3)`

Between Prescott (`17.5`), Brown (`18.3`), and Nelson (`11.8`), you'd think this team would be solid, but it still seems like Ean's top heavy draft has really hurt his changes this year. He had five players fail to turn in at least seven points. There are still far too many holes on this team for it to be a contender.

### 10. Adler (DAS ADLERHORN)
`[-2]` `103.1` `(4-1)`

Adler's team isn't good, but he's getting wins anyways. This week he faced off with league-dunce Alex Chapla and predictably came away with a win despite only putting up 103. Jordan Howard (`23.8`) needed a big game to push this team into triple digits. It's not good, but it keeps winning. If Adler manages to turn this team around late in the season somehow, he's perfectly poised for some kind of post season run. With the return of Gronk, and knowing OBJ can't be kept down for the entire season it's definitely possible, but for now we'll keep this team low where it belongs, despite its record.

### 11. Mike (BALL'S FRAGILE BALLS)
`[+1]` `101.6`  `(1-4)`

Mike played Nixon last week and their performances look remarkably similar. Both had bad weeks aside from one player who broke out for nearly thirty points. Don't let it fool you, this team still sucks. This was Mike's first 100+ point performance, and it still looked pretty ugly. Mike will need to find more consistent output if he wants to contend, but at 1-4 things look quite bleak.

### 12. Nixon (NIXON BALL'S FANTASY TEAM)
`[-1]` `105.7` `(2-3)`

Sammie Coates was this entire team last week. Were it not for his 28.9 point effort this team would have likely put up its fourth loss. Five weeks in, I think we can confidently say this team is doomed to hang around in the double digits, relying on breakout performances to make it above 100. That's not a fun place to be, and Nixon will need to find some way to turn that story around if he wants to be relevant in the post season.

### 13. Forrest (HEATS ON IN THE TETONS)
`[-5]` `71.3` `(0-5)`

Good god. When we last left this team in the week 3 rankings I made fun of this team for not having won a single game. Guess what? I took a whole fucking week off and nothing changed with this team. Forrest's team is atrocious, averaging just 87 points a game. There's nothing more to say here, this team sucks and I've already spent too much time writing about it.

### 14. Alex (DONALD TRUMP'S TINY CAUCUS)
`[--]` `90.1` `(1-4)`

You suck.
