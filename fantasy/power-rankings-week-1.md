# Doug Black Official Power Rankings
## Week 1

### 1. Jimmy (STEPHANIA BELL GRANDE) 130.5

The week's points leader, and everyone chipped in. The only player on this team to turn in a single digit performance was the Chiefs D/ST with zero points. I honestly don't have much criticism to dole out on this team, it's got a lot of star power that I expect to be able to turn in similar 115+ performances week to week. Stafford's offense finally looks good (I respect the Stafford-over-Palmer choice this team made this week, good ownership), David Johnson had a characteristically strong performance. Hopkins has potential with a promising QB feeding him the ball. Olsen is going to show up as always. This team got help with better-than-expected performances from Charles Simms and Sterling Shepard, but the core of this team is strong enough that they have the look of a early season contender for sure.

### 2. AJ (WAR BORTLES) 123.9

Eli had a middling QB performance, but the team as a whole showed up together with a whopping *7* players showing up for 10+ points. After Drew Brees-fed Brandin Cooks broke out for 30 and Carlos Hyde broke out for 22, this team didn't need much else to hit the upper echelon of PF this week. A solid showing all around. I wonder if Bortles will show up in Week 2?

### 3. Neill (COUSIN RANDY'S REAWAKENING) 123.2

Unfortunately, Winston looked poised, confident, and most of all accurate during the Buc's 31-24 win over the Falcons on Sunday. He has every likelihood of remaining a top-5 Fantasy QB this season. With Winston the highest performer at 25.5 and with 6 other players cracking double digit points, this team is solid. Relying on both Julio Jones and Mohamed Sanu could end up costing this team, but it didn't this week. With Devonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman on this team as well, it seems Neill is really high on the Falcon's chances this year. I expect this teams success to be closely tied to the Falcons, who I honestly don't think are going to be good.

### 4. Todd (A TEAM HAS NO NAME) 114.6

This team showed depth across multiple position groups. WRs Maclin and Crabtree brough in 13.7 and 14.7 points respectively, while the RB group was dominated by DeAngelo Williams' break out 32.1. I don't expect DeAngelo to bring in nearly that amount over the next two weeks Le'Veon Bell is suspended, but he's shown he can contribute to the Steelers offense on the ground. Gary Barnidge pulled in zero points, but with McCown returning to the helm of the Brown's offense I expect he'll be alright going forward. A lot to like here, especially seeing Danny Woodhead's 20 points from the bench go completely unaccounted for. With Keenan Allen down he's an attractive start in the RB slots.

### 5. Doug (BEAUTIFUL DARK TWISTED FANTASY) 113

It's not often you would expect a team with Dez Bryant and Demaryius Thomas ends up needing to be carried by its RBs, but after showing up for a measly 8.1 points *combined*, there might be questions if these two WRs will show up this season. On the RB side, Riddick soared and Ezekiel Elliot and T.J. Yeldon turned in solid performances. With Green Bay's offense looking like they've returned to form, Rodgers looks like a solid QB pickup. Assuming this week ends up being an outlier for these typically-good WRs, this team looks strong.

### 6. Ryan (ALPHA KENYBODY) 119

A decent amount of depth went into this performance. Peterson failed to show up, it will be interesting if the hopeful addition of Bradford will open up more opportunities for him in week 2. Big Ben had a typically solid night, Amari Cooper has a strong future, Julius Thomas was able to show up. This team got to 119 through a group effort. Ivory seems to have come down with a mysterious medical issue, if he's out Isaiah Crowell could actually be a decent addition from this team's bench.

### 7. Forrest (HEATS ON IN THE TETONS) 120.3

Brees put on a show against the Raider's presumed-good defense and blew up for 31 points. I don't expect Spencer Ware to be able to show up for over twenty points each week, but with Lamar Miller and Ryan Mathews rounding out this RB stable there's a lot to like on this team. With a poor WR showing and news out of Buffalo that Watkins is going to have to play through the pain of his surgically-repaired foot it puts this WR's season on shaky ground.

### 8. Mike S (KNOCK ON EVANS DOOR) 106.8

Cousins could prove a misstep on this roster, as the much-hyped QB only turned in 10 points against the Steelers last night. Was this just the Steel Curtain showing up to put a damper on talks of a long-term Cousins contract? Maybe. Without AJ Green's 30 point domination over Revis Island this team would have been hurting. But there's not a lot of reason to doubt AJ Green's season if he can put up those kind of numbers on Revis. With Keenan Allen on Sunday with a torn jACL, Melvin Gordon's going to benefit from increased workload, but outside of Evans, Gordon and Green this team looks a bit thin.

### 9. Dave (LARRY LEGEND'S VICTORY LAP) 129.3

A strong performance, though this team still looks weak. This team relied on a 35 point game from Luck, a 24 point game from Fitzgerald, a 20 point game from DeMarco Murray, and an 18 point game from Forte to hit this point total. They're all solid (not great) players, but I question the likelihood of similarly choreographed performances during the rest of the season. Tavon Austin looks like he's not going to end up having a strong season in LA, I wouldn't be surprised if he gets replaced in the coming weeks. If you only looked at PF you'd expect a lot from this team, but I think they'll regress pretty heavily down into the 90-100 range in week 2.

### 10. Nixon (NIXON BALL'S FANTASY TEAM) 101.5

Without Dan Bailey's league leading 17 points here, this team was leaning dangerously close to the 90s. This team should be good on paper, but they didn't have a strong week one showing, owing mostly to absolutely no standout performances across Arian Foster, Julian Edelman, Randall Cobb, and Emmanuel Sanders. You'd think two or maybe even three of them would be good for 15+, but it wasn't so this week. Abdullah popped off 20.5 from the bench, and having watched the Lions game I consider him an attractive start, but I'm not sure who you end up dropping from the RB slots of this team. All in all, a middling performance by a team of middling performers.

### 11. Adler (DAS ADLERHORN) 98.8

Matt Ryan and Willie Snead had standout games here, bringing in 24 and 27 points respectively. Outside of that this team was boring. Mark Ingram and Christine Michael are not what you want for RB1 and RB2. OBJ needs more targets for this team to see success, and I'd drop that Catanzaro like a sack of rocks after seeing his botched game-winner Sunday night--not because he's bad but because that snapper can't do his one and only job correctly. Over on the bench, Brock Osweiller-fed Will Fuller dropped 19.2 on Chicago. It will be interesting if he snags starting WR spot in week 2.

### 12. Ean (MR. 500) 102.6

The Raiders DST handed this team the loss last week, turning in a painful -2 points during a 4 point loss to Mike S. Antonio Brown looked dominant (though was he seventy five dollars dominant?) and Doug Baldwin showed up, but outside those two this team looks middling a best. Jordy Nelson should have a decent season, but spending money on Jimmy Graham and Ryan Fitzpatrick were questionable moves by this owner that we'll have to wait and evaluate once we get a few more weeks into the season.

### 13. Mike H (NOT-FAT MIKE) 95.5

Were it not for an unlikely standout performance by C.J. Anderson against a Panthers D who last season was famed against the run, this team would have been been saying hello to a PF in the 80s. Russell Wilson had trouble putting points on the board against a potentially stifling Miami D, but news that he's injured might force Wilson to the bench for his Ginger Ninja replacement Andy Dalton. Even in the high-scoring Lions/Colts game T.Y. Hilton wasn't able to find the endzone, and with Frank Gore and Brandon Marshall rounding out the roster here I don't expect a magical turn around next week without some pretty major roster moves.

### 14. Alex (DONALD TRUMP'S TINY CAUCUS) 63.6

Terrible showing last week. Gurley looks to be in a super shitty situation, if that holds during the season this team is in trouble, as Alex blew $57 on the RB. Also needs to dump that DST if trouncing by the Gabbert led Niners is any indication.
