# Doug Black Official Power Rankings
## Week 3

I know what you're thinking.

> Last week these were shitty, this week nothing's going to change.

Right you are. I'm currently running late to work writing these shits on three hours of sleep because I imagined my imaginary girlfriend's imaginary flight imaginarily landed very late last night and I'm running on little sleep and hopping myself on as much caffine as possible before I head into work. But you don't care. None of you care. The _rankings_, Doug. Where are the _rankings_, Doug? Doug, why aren't there _rankings_ yet? Doug, Doug, Doug. You know what my favorite Disney move is? Wall-E. I'm thinking about Wall-E right now and how everyone just expected him to pick up and compact trash for years and years, making the planet day by day while getting no recognition for all of his hard work. I feel you Wall-E. That's me with the power rankings.

Of course, Wall-E got lucky when a total dimepiece dropped out of the sky one day and took him on a magical adventure through the cosmos. Will this season be my Eve? Will I finally be crowned champion, instantly rewarding me for the reams and reams of dank af, grade-A, top-notch O-fucking-C I've giften upon this league? I think so. This is my year.

Wall-E is so good. Fuck.

### 1. Dave (LARRY LEGEND'S VICTORY LAP)
`116.6` `(3-0)`

Last week I admitted mistake during my week 1 rankings where I doubted this team. I'm glad I reversed course early, as Dave is our league leader in points-for (`367`) having turned in his third 115+ performance. Seven of Dave's nine starters are top-10 at their position groups. Seven. This squad is the stuff of nightmares, and their consistently high output through week three is enough to move them to our number one spot. For all of this praise, the one area I see this team struggling mightily in is bench-depth which I expect to hit this team once its bye weeks start. The bench is weak, and once those players start rotating in there will be some tough management decisions on Dave's hands.

### 2. Jimmy (STEPHANIA BELL GRANDE)
`[-1]` `102.2` `(2-1)`

Last week's power rankings leader took a hit this week, with Jimmy's weakest performance of the season during a 9 point loss to Neill, who dropped 64+ points on Monday night to swoop in for a last minute victory. So what happened here? Palmer (`3.5`) and Hopkins (`7.6`) had unusually poor showings. Last week I called Jimmy out for starting Palmer over Stafford. He reversed course here, and it burned him hard, as Stafford's 26.5 point performance would have been more than enough to pull a W out this week. You win some, you lose some. I still feel good about this team, as even in a down week they stayed above 100.

### 3. Mike (TWO TDS AND THAT DENVER D)
`[+3]` `112.1` `(3-0)`

Mike is consistent. This makes sense, when you realize six of his nine starters are top-10 at their position groups. WRs A.J. Green (`11.7`) and Mike Evans (`24.2`) would be WR1's on most squads in the league. With Melvin Gordon averaging 17.7 points a game, this squad is stacked where it matters. Interestingly, no player on Mike's team averages over 20, while seven of his nine starters average 10+. Depth abound here. Mike's QB situation remains one of the weaker ones in the league, but this team is getting it done regardless. Now that I'm done being civil, god fucking damnit. This is the second week in a row Mike moved up three spots in these fucking rankings. Someone stop him. Nixon, we're counting on you this week.

### 4. AJ (WAR BORTLES)
`[-1]` `106.6` `(2-1)`

AJ bounced back from last week's close loss with an easy victory over Todd. We're now three weeks into the season and I still feel comfortable saying this team is orbiting top tier. Marvin Jones (`35.5`) absolutely exploded on Green Bay this week, and currently sits atop the rankings for a WR this season. However, with Langford (`5.6`) and Delanie Walker (`0`) dealing with injury issues, AJ is likely scrambling to put together a roster capable of competing this week. Issues aside, of the sixteen players on this roster half of them are _averaging_ double digits this season, so this team remains a weekly threat and seasonal contender.

### 5. Doug (BEAUTIFUL DARK TWISTED FANTASY)
`[+2]` `125.5` `(3-0)`

Doug (third person is cool) was last week's point leader and remains undefeated through week three. He benefited from five players showing up with double digit performances, which is always a good sight to see. Demaryius Thomas (`17`) and Dez Bryant (`11.5`) were finally able to have some respectable performances, but remain 25 and 45 at their respective position groups and continue to not justify the money he spent on them. This coming week could prove challenging for this roster as Rodgers is on bye, Vereen is out, and Bryant is questionable. With Doug's lowest performance this season coming in at 109, this teams consistency brings it towards the top.

### 6. Neill (COUSIN RANDY'S REMEMBERANCE)
`[-2]` `111.3` `(2-1)`

This clown started four Atlanta Falcons players this week. Fucking four! The fantasy gods apparently thought that was a fucking riot and decided to reward him for such laughably terrible strategy by granting Freeman (`29.2`) and Coleman (`28.4`) each their best performances of the season. I have no real words. This team composition is a crime against fantasy but it's just so crazy that if he can get it to perform at the right time he stays in the conversation. I'm dropping him in this weeks rankings though, mostly because I'm bitter about this being even remotely successful, and because I think this team is a mid season trainwreck waiting to happen. He can't keep getting away with it!

### 7. Todd (A TEAM HAS NO NAME)
`[-2]` `64.1` `(1-2)`

Todd turned in the second worst performance of the season last week (current worst team is Chapla from week 1 with 63.6). Surprising for a team that eclipsed 110 on its first two outings? Yeah. But, Todd's roster lost Woodhead last week to IR and this week it got help from nowhere. Rivers (`11.4`) turned in this team's top performance, and Todd made the questionable move of starting Marshall (`4.2`) over Crabtree (`14.2`), so the WR core here flailed. There's not a ton to say here, but power rankings are--in a way--a measure of consistent peaks, and a team shitting the bed with a sub-70 performance can't be glossed over due to a history of strong performances.

### 8. Adler (DAS ADLERHORN)
`[--]` `98.1` `(2-1)`

This motherfucker started Gronk (`0`). Hilarious. No, in all honesty this looks like it could have been a good week for Adler had the Jets D/ST (`1`) and kicker Nick Folk (`3`) not decided to take a day off. Last week, if you'll remember, the Jets singlehandedly lost him the game with a -2 point performance in a 1.6 point loss. But he turns around and starts them again this week! I haven't seen such blind homerism guide a roster decision in a while. But, with four double digit performances from this squad this is the first sign of life from this group that we've seen all season.

### 9. Forrest (HEATS ON IN THE TETONS)
`[--]` `97.8` `(0-3)`

Forrest hasn't won a game. After opening the season with a 120 point effort that still resulted in a loss to Jimmy, Forrest has now missed the three digit mark for the second time in a row. The Vikings D (`23`) showed up well for him, but Ryan Matthews's (`-0.5`) poor performance ensured this team stayed winless three weeks into the season. Of Forrest's fifteen man roster, only his QBs, kicker, and defense rank in the top twenty at their position. This team just doesn't have the talent right now.

### 10. Ean (MR. 500)
`[+2]` `124` `(2-1)`

Ean had a good week. Despite Fitzpatrick (`-2.3`) being worse than starting a QB at all, his team put together a 124 point performance on the backs of Antonio Brown (`20`), Jordy Nelson (`25`) and Doug Baldwin (`26`). Following these performances, _five_ of his players rank top-7 at their position groups. I'm sure this feels good, and this gives us a taste of what this roster is capable of when all of its players explode, but I continue to give this team knocks for its paltry depth. You just can't bet on these kinds of performances week in and week out, and I am willing to bet this is the best week this team ever has.

### 11. Nixon (NIXON BALL'S FANTASY TEAM)
`[--]` `111.2` `(1-2)`

Nixon turned in his first 110+ point performance last week, though it didn't come easy. McCoy (`25.1`), Sanders (`28.2`) and the Patriots D/ST (`18`) had to come through with stellar performances to make up for weak outings by Randall Cobb (`3.8`) and Clive Waiford (`3.7`). You can't get far in this league giving starting opportunities to players who fail to make it to even five points. I'm sure it feels good to finally drop an average performance but it won't be handing this team any serious motion in this week's power rankings.

### 12. Mike (NOT-FAT MIKE)
`[+2]` `99.5` `(0-3)`

With Blount's 23.5 point Thursday night performance it seemed Mike was on his way to a win, but the Steelers (`-4`) and C.J. Anderson (`4.6`) had other ideas. This one hurts, as amongst the failures there were strong successes, as Blount and T.Y. Hilton (`27.4`) put out a combined 50.9 points. Not to even mention the bench throwing up 72.5 points in a game he only needed 13 to win. Sorry dude. However, what does it say when, on a week in which two of your starters players give you a fifty point head start, you still fail to quite touch 100 with the other seven people you chose as starters? Nothing good. With Mike's third straight sub-100 performance (this one by just a hair) and consequent loss, this team continues to struggle.

### 13. Ryan (ALPHA KENYBODY)
`[-3]` `68.9` `(0-3)`

First off hats off to Ryan for producing the best league note of the season so far. I hope others participate in this legendary tradition of league culture. Anyways, this was Ryan's second straight sub-90 performance. I looked at the point breakdown for his team this week and I had to go take a shower because of how fucking gross it is. Allen Robinson (`21.2`) was the whole team. I know, I know, each week I end up having some dumb sentence where I say, "Player X was the whole team", but in this case it's truer than ever. Guess what second best scorer on the team was? Alshon Jeffrey limping in with 9.5 points. The only top-10 player on this team is the fucking kicker. Make some changes, Ryan.

### 14. Alex (DONALD TRUMP'S TINY CAUCUS)
`[-1]` `106.9` `(0-3)`

Through three weeks, Alex is the lowest scoring team in the league, coming up last in points-for (`259.7`). On a positive note, Gurley (`20`) awoke from his two game slumber and decided to maybe start living up to expectations. But this team is averaging 86 points a game and looking terrible while doing it. I'm sure you've noticed during this week's rankings but I've begun to call out position rankings, as in week three they are just starting to be interesting. Well, I took a look at Alex's team and wasn't fucking surprised but what I saw. Alex's team has just _one_ player in the top-10 at their position group. Who are first and second? Dwayne Allen at 15th and Green Bay D/ST at 16th. Those are both positions most people only hold only one of, yet Chapla doesn't even have the 14th best at their given position. It's like being 16th in a race of 14!

Chapla, you're the only one in the league getting a two paragraph justification for their power rankings and here's why: make some fucking changes dude, your team is terrible! "Why do you care so much about how well I do, Doug!?", you might be saying. Because dude! You've seen the fucking scrollback! We spent the better part of a weekend arguing about if we should add your District of Columbian ass to this league and you're just rolling in here dick in hand taking a shit all over our good graces. The Rick contingency of the league was vocal back then and they're just now finding their voice and starting to bitch again. This isn't good for the league, and you're the only one who can stop it. You know what? I'm calling an audible, I think you need a third paragraph just for extra effect.

Do better.
