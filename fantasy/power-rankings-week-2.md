# Doug Black Official Power Rankings
## Week 2

Hi everyone. Apologies for the late rankings but I've been spending the entire week in Atlanta recruiting for Twilio during the day and getting totally plastered with old college buddies at night. I spent an hour and a half sitting in the food court at CNN headquarters, chugging coffee and fighting through an increasingly shitty hangover, working on these rankings.

I hope you find them awesome/enraging/moronic. And I hope you tell me all about how you feel in the groupme.

### 1. Jimmy (STEPHANIA BELL GRANDE) `[--]` `114.9` ``(2-0)``

Another great performance from this squad. With six players turning in double digit performance this team continues to display strong depth. I don't really understand why Jimmy put Palmer on the bench in favor of Stafford and it didn't work out for him, but all in all this team is an obvious contender. I would write more here but there's really not much else to it, this team is solid.

### 2. Dave (LARRY LEGEND'S VICTORY LAP) `[+8]` `121.3` ``(2-0)``

Strong performance by Dave last week. It was a true team effort with 6 of the 9 roster slots putting up double digit performances. Last week I said this team is unlikely to receive choreographed, strong performances again from Murray, Fitzgerald, Forte, and Luck and called them good, but not great players. I was wrong. All of them except for Luck showed up again this week, so I'm eating a bit of crow right now. This team looks strong right now and with Dave's second 120+ point performance I feel good about moving them up several slots. We all make mistakes. I mean you all make a lot more than me that's why my life is awesome and everything, but even Doug, god of fantasy football rankings has on this day erred. I resolve to do better in the future.

### 3. AJ (WAR BORTLES) `[-1]` `95.8` ``(1-1)``

AJ's team put up 180 points across every player on his roster, but unfortunately 83.8 of those points were scored harmlessly from the bench, leaving his starters to put up a boring 95 points and ultimately lose his week 2 matchup. I looked it up, and most benches typically turn in under 40 points, with a few making it all the way up into the 60's. But AJ's 85 bench points are truly amazing. Sucks. However, power rankings are smart enough to realize that this team still has fantastic potential were it not for some ownership missteps this week.


### 4. Neill (COUSIN RANDY'S REMEMBERANCE) `[--]` `94.9` ``(1-1)``

I had Neill at #3 last week and I first thought he really let me down this week. After looking a bit closer though this just looks like a fluke performance. QB Jameis Winston only turned in 4 points and four interceptions during a 40 point shellacking from the stoic Cardinals D/ST. Unfortunately, this week Winston is up against Seattle, and though they're no 2014 powerhouse right now he's not the most ideal QB to start this week. Neill doesn't have a QB to swap in from his bench as he's currently using up two slots on suspended players Brady and Gordon. The Falcons, who if you'll remember from week 1 I noted are all over this team (Freeman, Jones, Sanu), had a great performance in a 35-28 victory over Oakland, but Julio Jones was the only real benefactor. Having three starters compete for touchdown opportunities likely puts a practical ceiling on what this team can do. I still see this team as having enough star power to have potential, but it's got some fundamental issues that could prove tough to out-manage. Also, it's been fun watching this team move through names as we've watched the rise and fall of Cousin Randy.

### 5. Todd (A TEAM HAS NO NAME) `[--]` `112.3` ``(1-1)``

The big news with this team is Woodhead's move to IR. It's potentially mitigated by DeAngelo Williams looking actually decent. He snagged a *career-high* 32 carries on his way to a 21 point performance and looks to have the backfield to himself once again this week so Todd has at least one more week of a decent RB stable. It says something that this team was able to lose an RB in the first quarter of the game and still manage to break the 110 barrier, so I continue to look favorably on this team's chances.

### 6. Mike (TWO TDS AND THAT DENVER D) `[+3]` `115.2` `(2-0)`

Yeah I know Mike broke the 110 barrier but I'm still a doubter. I think. Last week's performance benefited mightily from a kicker and a defense combining for 39 points. You can maybe count on Denver showing up for at least 12 most weeks, but Graham Gano putting up 18? Fuck off. (but thanks Graham!). When you look a little closer at the performance you see that only two of his RB/WR/TEs even cracked double digits. Melvin Gordon looked good, but he was hanging out on the bench. Unfortunately, Mike Simpson is kind of like the--god I hate that I'm going to say this--this league's fatter, stupider, less attractive Bill Belichek in that he always seems to find a way to be in contention. So now that I've made that Belichek comparison I am legally bound by my duty as a power ranker to overrate the shit out of this team. Fuck you Mike. Fuck you.

### 7. Doug (BEAUTIFUL DARK TWISTED FANTASY) `[-1]` `109.5` `(2-0)`

Both Dez and Demaryius were able to show up with decent 13 point performances, but for the amount of money I dropped on these two I'd really like to see some more value out of them for their combined $76 price tag. Were it not for a huge 23 point game from the Cardinals D/ST this was a likely loss. In good news, Elliot showed up and Rodgers managed to squeeze 17 points out of a game that only saw the Packers drop 14.

### 8. Adler (DAS ADLERHORN) `[+4]` `92.7` `(1-1)`

Adler's 1.6 point loss last weekend must have really hurt. With the Jets D/ST deciding to fuck him over to the tune of -2 points, all he had to do to win this game was not play a defense at all. But that's just the tip of the iceberg. Travis Benjamin had himself a game with a 26 point performance, but he was sitting idly on Adler's bench. 26 points. Lost by 1.6. Lmao. Martellus Bennett decided this probably wasn't traumatizing enough to Adler's already weak psyche, so he decided to join in on the fun and snag 114 yards and a touchdown on his way to a 19.9 point performance. So to recap on this shit show, Jets D/ST subtracts 2 while Bennett and Benjamin combine for 45 from the bench. During a matchup decided by one point six points. I love everything about this. Thank you Adler. With the second week of a team performance in the nineties, at the end of the day this team is mediocre.

### 9. Forrest (HEATS ON IN THE TETONS) `[-1]` `73.3` `(0-2)`

Ouch. Probably the most surprising thing for me last weekend was Brees only managing a single touchdown against the Giants. Wow. Big if true. Beyond that, every single player aside from Ryan Matthews just plain out sucked on this team. With hindsight Forrest might have managed to work Tyrod Taylor (24 points) over Brees and Dennis Pitta (14 points) over Charles Clay, but even with perfect roster management last week this team would have sucked. In week 1 this team managed 120 but I put them at 7th and I called out in my power rankings that he relied on a massive 31 point performance from Spencer Ware and that he obviously won't be able to rely on consistently. I thought I'd have to wait a little longer for this team to fully shit the bed, I guess I was wrong.

### 10. Ryan (ALPHA KENYBODY) `[-3]` `82.3` `(0-2)`

Only three players cracked double digits. With Peterson out this team is suddenly dealing with an real lack of depth at RB, and unless that situation gets rectified soon I see this team having a rough go of it for the rest of the season. This team also deals with diversity issues, as with two players each from Jacksonville and Oakland this team competes for touchdowns a lot amongst itself. All in all, mediocre.

### 11. Nixon (NIXON BALL'S FANTASY TEAM) `[--]` `94.3` `(1-1)`

First off, pick a damn team name you lazy sack of shit. Secondly, this team is still not good. Just like I said in week 1, it looks like a squad of players who should be in good on paper but who have completely failed to turn in anything even remotely interesting over the past two games. It's looking like Denver WR's are in for a rough season, as for the second week in a row Emmanuel Sanders failed to crack double digits. All in all, middling performance by a team of middling performers.

### 12. Ean (MR. 500) `[+1]` `89.2` `(1-1)`

It's week 2 now and I can confidently say Ean's team looked exactly what I thought it would look like based upon his draft style. He went hard for big name players early on and broke the bank and ended up having trouble competing for talent in the later stages of the draft to fill out all of his spots. With injured Doug Martin (hamstring) and Charcandrick West being the starting RBs here--and with no relief in sight--this team's RB situation is dire. In any case, he was up against Not-Fat Mike, and that performance was even shittier so he managed to avoid his second loss in a row.

### 13. Alex (DONALD TRUMP'S TINY CAUCUS) `[+1]` `106.9` `(0-2)`

This looks like a respectable week 2 performance on the surface, but if you go a little deeper you'll see that our last place finisher in the week 1 power rankings has done little to get out of its precarious position. Newton (29.8) and Decker (21.6) constitute this entire team. As I mentioned in my week 1 rankings, (7.5) Gurley looks unlikely to be able to repeat his breakout rookie season while operating in a lackluster Ram offense. I expect this team to have a double digit performance in week 2 as Newton's up against a stifling Vikings D.

### 14. Mike (NOT-FAT MIKE) `[-1]` `73.9` `(0-2)`

I'm sure Mike is looking at his bench and thinking, "if I would have only started Blount my squad would be great", but he's wrong. You're wrong Mike. Get smarter. At best with 20/20 hindsight he could have only gotten an extra 13 points from such a move, and he'd still not have even made it to 90. This team has some major output problems starting at the middle of the roster down.
